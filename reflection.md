I asked Camila about why should we define rounds and how it relates to the for loop. I attended the Tueseday TA and asked Chris about why my transcript didn't show up and it turned out that I put the for loop in the wrong bracket.

My initial impression of Java is that it's so hard to use, compared to Python. For instance, asking for user input would be so easy in Python with only one line of code, but in Java I need to create a new scanner object and refer back to it whenever I want to receive another user input.

Though Java seems a bit rigid in terms of syntax and format, I can tell that it is a more structured way of programming, which makes it easy to create reusable code.

For this assignment, I struggled mainly with Java syntax and also indentation. Especially when writting for loops, without indentation, the brackets made it very complicated to tell whether or not is the code inside the loop. Plus that VS code kept telling me that there are some problems in my code when I haven't finish the whole thing, I was really confused about what's the correct syntax. It's good to get yourself used to java syntax and also write pseudo code before starting the assignment, because I feel like it's relatively more difficult to test out things in Java than Python due to all the format restrictions.
